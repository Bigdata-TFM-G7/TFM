2,5,Y,B00Q9KEZV0,Tomorrow Is My Turn,FIve Stars and Then Some,Music,"Rhiannon Giddens has one of the stellar voices of our time.  This is her first album and hopefully only the first of many.  She is right on target with her voice, her song choices, and every arrangement."

4,4,Y,B00AIUSGJE,Meet The Supremes,Great recording of the early Supremes when the trio was ...,Music,Great recording of the early Supremes when the trio was cohesive and shared leads. The recording is an early time bottle to the early 60's before Berry Gordy took an intense interest in the career of Diana Ross.

6,4,Y,B000J103UC,Greatest Hits: The Atlantic Years,Great album. My only problem is every time I ...,Music,"Great album. My only problem is every time I try to import it to iTunes, it sounds very staticky. But it's a very fun album. Go P.O.D.!"
7,5,N,B00J3FHZ38,Jeroen Van Veen: Piano Music,Lots of surprises in 5 discs of wonderful compositions!,Music,"You’d be hard pressed to think of anyone who’s done more to promote contemporary piano composition, particularly that in the “minimalist” vein, than the Dutch performer, Jeroen Van Veen. His protean efforts have yielded a wide range of voluminous recordings, all expertly performed in an exciting range of styles.<br /><br />It’s not surprising, then, that he’s used his encyclopedic knowledge to also create a 5-disc offering of his own compositions, all excellent and the whole collection a listening delight. While it’s hard to briefly comment on so many CD’s, suffice it to say that the first three discs are openly minimalist in their origins and are hypnotic in their appeal, some cuts meditative while others will want to make you get up and dance (yes, I did). The range is delicious, including some engaging uses of prepared pianos, carillon, tape and organ. The fourth disc takes off in some unexpected directions, including a fascinating essay on the four elements and one of my favorites, “Repeating History,” a thrilling mash-up of fragments of classical compositions to which minimalist music is indebted, knowingly or not, and all knitted together seamlessly with Van Veen’s compositional threads. The last CD is NLXL, inspired by the aerial photography of Holland by Karel Tomei. There’s a great video (viewable on YouTube) of Van Veen and his wife, Sandra, performing it with huge projections of the photos behind them. I find this format more effective for the piece and while the Van Veens use a wide range of interesting techniques to accompany their two pianos (including ambient sounds), some themes overstay their welcome a bit for me without the visuals.<br /><br />So, a LOT of music to enjoy from a composer/performer of great passions and a lively imagination. Definitely worth exploring!"

17,5,N,B012VIWG28,Brainwavz Hengja - The Headphone Desk Hanger,"Simple hanger; clamp is strong, with a pad; hanger swivels to accommodate many possible attachment locations",Electronics,"Can't get any simpler that this.  And it works just about anywhere you can find a flat lip or side panel.  Ideally the lip should be at least 1 3/8&#34; for best stability, but I got it to hold decently well on the short lip of my desk top, which is just 3/4&#34;.<br /><br />Because the front hanger piece can be adjusted to hang parallel or perpendicular, (or any angle in between), to the clamping surface, I was able to get the firmest grip on the side of a bookcase.  My best idea, and where I use it now, is attached to the arm of my executive style office chair, near where it meets the chair back.  I don't knock it with my arm or elbow as I raise/lower/turn in my chair.  It is really a nifty place to stow the headphones--within easy reach, but not a cumbersome location either.<br /><br />It is well-constructed with  good layer of powder coating on the metal.  Hardware looks to be top quality, too.<br /><br />*I received a sample product from Brainwavz."

28,4,N,B00SMBG8NC,VIZIO SB3820-C6 38-Inch 2.0 Channel Sound Bar,Very satisfied.,Home Entertainment,"The sound is good for the price. It sounds better for music than it does for movies. Easy to set up too. I was expecting it to work like surround sound which it does not. I use this sound bar in my bedroom at night and therefore don't have it turned up super loud, but it does have clear sound and works as well as the more expensive one I have downstairs in the living room. Rear speakers only provide music rather than voice. Overall, this is a great sound system for someone on a limited budget."

Repair tech said it was a known problem with the series and Vizio was aware of it but they weren't taking responsibility and assisting customers...  So recommend buying any other brand...
31,1,N,B00WA42GTC,Samsung Blu-ray Player with Wi-Fi and HDMI Cable,"Wouldn't recommend this Samsung Blu-Ray player (BD-JM57C), especially as a dedicated streaming device.",Home Entertainment,"This Samsung BD-JM57C is not much beyond a basic Blu-Ray player. NOTE: There is absolutely NO light display of ANY kind on this player--No LED On/Off indicator; No indication of &#34;Command Recieved&#34; (from remote); NO illuminated tray when disc tray is open; and No LED display to indicate play, skip, track, open/close, etc. Consequently, operating this player in a dark room can be a challenge. The only way to tell that the player is powered ON is to press the open/close disc tray, which actually turns on the player if it was off. Unless you don't mind your player constantly powered on with access to the Internet, then this might not be a problem for you. The player does have a few mainstream apps (Amazon, Hulu+, Netflix, YouTube, Pandora...), but not &#34;all your favorite apps and web content&#34; as advertised.The Opera TV app does offer a large number of options; however, as one reviewer described them: the Channels/apps are &#34;misfits&#34; and pretty much &#34;JUNK TV.&#34; The device indicates &#34;Loading Browser&#34; (on the TV screen) when opening Opera TV, but there's really NO FUNCTIONAL browser for the user. My unit tends to freeze for 15-20 seconds after initially loading the main screen; and with NO DISPALY, I have no idea what is happening until the locked screen suddenly jumps to the &#34;stale&#34; commands I entered earlier on the remote. I have struggled to find a feature/benefit of this Samsung BD-JM57C that merits the price tag,. I think Samsung rushed this player to market just to have a 2015 model. I think it's poor business practice to rely on updates to bring your product up to par. I returned my unit, and honestly can't recommend this player, even as a loyal Samsung customer of 10yrs."
